# Token Lean
Want to look around corners without moving your token? Stack up on a door and peek around? Just lean!  
While holding down the lean button (default q), your token's vision and light source are moved towards your mouse.  
The maximum distance you can lean is configurable.  

## Now compatible with Levels!
The current implementation is probably a little fragile. Please submit a bug report if you have any issues.  
  
## Planned features
- adjust token position to follow the lean a small amount and be visible to other players
- gracefully handle leaning towards walls
