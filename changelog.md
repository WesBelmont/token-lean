# 2.0.0
- Rewrite of almost the entire code base.
- Token leaning is visible to other players.
- Tokens can no longer lean when the game is paused.
- The tokens actually move, which means if a player leans over a trigger, it will be set off.
- Movement caused by leaning is ignored by the history buffer, so you can still undo events properly.
- Added option to allow/disallow leaning in combat.
